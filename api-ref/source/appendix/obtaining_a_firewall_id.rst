Obtaining a Firewall ID
=======================

A firewall ID (**fw_instance_Id**) is a CFW instance ID. It is automatically generated by the system after CFW is created.

You can obtain the value by calling the API for :ref:`Querying the Firewall List <listfirewalllist>`.

-  By default, if **fw_instance_Id** is not specified, information about the first firewall under the account is returned. If **fw_instance_Id** is specified, information about the firewall with this **fw_instance_Id** is returned.
-  If **object_Id** is specified, information about the firewall with this **object_Id** is returned by default. If both **fw_instance_Id** and **object_Id** are specified, the specified **object_Id** must belong to the specified firewall.
