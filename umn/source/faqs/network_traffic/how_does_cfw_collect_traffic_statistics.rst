How Does CFW Collect Traffic Statistics?
========================================

Currently, CFW collects traffic statistics based on sessions. Traffic data is reported when the connection is terminated.

.. note::

   -  The overall traffic of the session is counted from the time the session starts to the time it ends.
   -  The Internet border involves inbound (internet originated) traffic and outbound (server originated) traffic.
