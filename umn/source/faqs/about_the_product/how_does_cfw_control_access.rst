How Does CFW Control Access?
============================

CFW allows you to configure ACL policies based on a 5-tuple, IP address group, service group, domain name, blacklist, and whitelist. You can also configure ACL policies based on the intrusion prevention system (IPS). The IPS can work in observation or block mode. In block mode, the firewall detects and blocks traffic that matches the IPS rules.
