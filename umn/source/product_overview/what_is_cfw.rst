What Is CFW?
============

Cloud Firewall (CFW) is a next-generation cloud-native firewall. It protects the Internet border and VPC border on the cloud by real-time intrusion detection and prevention, global unified access control, full traffic analysis, log audit, and tracing. It employs AI for intelligent defense, and can meet changing business needs, helping you easily handle security threats. CFW is a basic service that provides network security protection for user services on the cloud.

Intelligent Defense
-------------------

CFW has integrated security capabilities and network threat intelligence. Its AI intrusion prevention engine can detect and block malicious traffic in real time. It works with other security services globally to defend against Trojans, worms, injection attacks, vulnerabilities, and phishing attacks.

High Scalability
----------------

CFW can implement refined control on all traffic, including Internet border and cross-VPC traffic, to prevent external intrusions, internal penetration attacks, and unauthorized access from internal to external networks. Its cluster is deployed in HA mode to protect your workloads under heavy traffic.

Easy-to-Use Application
-----------------------

As a cloud-native firewall, CFW can be enabled easily, import multi-engine security policies with a few clicks, automatically check assets within seconds, and provide a UI for performing operations, greatly improving management and defense efficiency.

Supported Access Control Policies
---------------------------------

-  Access control based on the 5-tuple (source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and protocol)
-  Access control based on the domain name
-  Access control based on the intrusion prevention system (IPS). The IPS works in observation or block mode. In block mode, CFW detects and blocks traffic that matches the IPS rules.
-  ACL access control policies set for IP address groups, blacklists, and whitelists
